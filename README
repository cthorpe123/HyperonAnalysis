This is a toolkit for performing the hyperon selection over samples of 
data and MC. The code consists of two main folders: Core/ containig objects
that handle importing and manipulating events, recording metadata and management 
of the other algs and Alg/ storing the individual selection algorithms.

To get set up and build the code:

source setup.sh
source Build.sh 

This code uses the ntuples created by the HyperonSelection_module.cc LArSoft module
and is designed to be run with root macros. 

To import into a root macro, include the following to the top of your macro:

###########################################

R__LOAD_LIBRARY($HYP_TOP/lib/libAlg.so)
R__LOAD_LIBRARY($HYP_TOP/lib/libCore.so)

#include "SelectionManager.h"
#include "EventAssembler.h"
#include "Cut.h"
#include "SelectionParameters.h"

#include "SampleSets_Example.h"
#include "Parameters.h"

###########################################

This imports the shared objects, includes the corresponding headers and sets up
the pre-defined parameter sets and sample sets.

A list of pre-sets for the selection are located in ParameterSets/Parameters.h.
You can then set up the selection by doing SelectionManager M(P) where P is the
parameter set you want to use.

Similarly, SampleSets/SampleSets_Example.h contains lists of ntuples typically
used together (ie hyperon+background+dirt+EXT+data). 

Several examples of using this code in root macros exist in examples/
